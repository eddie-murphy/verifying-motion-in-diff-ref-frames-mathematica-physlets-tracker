### Experimentally verified the relationship between motion in inertial and non-inertial reference frames by using a vision-based object tracker, a rotating platform, and Mathematica.

* Designed and performed an experiment to verify the relationship between motion in inertial and non-inertial reference frames by using a vision-based object tracker and a rotating platform for a laboratory class
* Found the numerical parametric solution to a system of differential equations and solved for the parameters using nonlinear regression and Mathematica
* Presented on the findings of the experiment in front of a panel of professors and students
