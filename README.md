### Experimentally verified the relationship between motion in inertial (*Non-rotating*) and non-inertial (*Rotating*) reference frames by using a vision-based object tracker, a rotating platform, and Mathematica.

* Designed and performed an experiment to verify the relationship between motion in inertial and non-inertial reference frames by using a vision-based object tracker (Physlets Tracker) and a rotating platform for a laboratory class
* Found the numerical parametric solution to a system of differential equations and solved for the parameters using nonlinear regression and Mathematica
* Presented on the findings of the experiment in front of a panel of professors and students

## Notes:
### Please look at the presentation under **presentation** folder for an overview of the experiment
* original video files have gone missing but tracker data in the form of .csv is included under **physlets_tracker_results**
* Two notebooks (in .nb and .pfg) contain the code used to determine values in the different reference frames
